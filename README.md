# This is a simple counter i did a while ago, while i was in Neobis programming club.
The purpose of this android app is to Count.
The user interface and the design are very basic, nothing fancy.
The counter is alighned in the center and there is a count button at the bottom right under counter.
Counter starts from 0 every time you press the count button it increases by 1.
I think it is useful for people, it can be used to count sheeps, your workout reps etc.
Budget for this project is 0$, except the electricity and time spent)
No partners were involved in the process.
